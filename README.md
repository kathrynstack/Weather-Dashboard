# <Weather Dashboard>

## Description

My motivation for creating this Weather Dashboard was to create a web application that utilized an API and Local Storage to deliver accurate and insightful weather forecasts.
I built this project not only to practice the knowledge I have learned with Javascript, but to effectively integrate a third-party API to display weather information, and to serve as a useful product. 
This Weather Dashboard solves the problem of a user wanting to see the current and future forecast of any city.
I learned how to utilize all of the knowledge I have gained in HTML/CSS/Javascript/Local Storage and API's to culminate a functional weather tool.
